# OfflinePlayers-Reworked 1.1.0 (MC 1.21.1)

**Update:**

- Removed "Other" dependencies
  
  OfflinePlayersReworked now doesn't work with a (JsonDB) database or MidnightLib. Instead it uses the Minecraft internal storage as well as SimpleConfig which has no dependencies.
- Fixed minor chat session error that showed when OfflinePlayer was spawned.
