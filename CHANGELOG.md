# OfflinePlayers-Reworked 1.0.8 (MC 1.21.1)

**Update:**

- Added `break` action 
  - which without interval does the same as `attack:0` but with interval it will break the block, then reset the interval timer ([Issue link](https://github.com/TheMisterFish/Fabric_OfflinePlayersReworked/issues/30))

  >Important note! If you have already installed the mod before; don't forget adding `break` to the `availableOptions` list in `config/OfflinePlayersReworked.json`.
